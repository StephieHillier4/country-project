          <p>Africa is the second largest continent by population, second to Asia, with 54 countries and over 1.5 billion people. Nigeria, capitol Lagos, is the largest city by population with over 200 million people. It is also considered the hottest and driest continent in the world with temperatures between 30-40 degrees celsius (almost 100 degrees fahrenheit) nearly every day in some areas. Africa is surrounded by two major oceans, the Atlantic to the East and Indian to the West, as well as, the Mediterranien and Red Seas to the North. It is believed to be the first home to human existence, culturalization, colonization, Trans-Atlantic slave trade and the Apartheid. With all of its ancient history, beautiful landscapes, exotic and rare wildlife, and abundant resources brings a negative impact from the human population of ignorance, greed and cruelty. Historic and present Africa are both heartwarming and heartbreaking, but also, incredibly eye opening and life changing.</p>

          <p>Africa has inspired some of the strongest, most inspirational people in the world. Dian Fossey, a brilliant primatologist and personal heroine of mine, is the reason I developed such a fascination for Africa at such a young age. Her devotion and research to ending the ongoing slaughter of the Mountain Gorillas and surrounding wildlife ended her life by poachers but left an impression on the world that will last a lifetime. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela served as the first black South African President for 5 years and was considered the world's most famous political prisoner. He practiced law at the University of Fort Hare and University of Witwatersrand while working as a night watchman. During his lifetime he was expelled from university (but eventually finished with a B.A degree), was a master of disguise evading authorities on several occasions, received guerrilla training, and eventually served a nearly 70 year prison sentence for his fight of human rights. Graca Machel is one of the most powerful African women, politician and humanitarian in history from Mozambique. Starting as a school teacher, she later became a Minister of Education and Culture, as well as, the President of the School of Oriental and African studies and the University of London. Working alongside greats, such as, Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela, she started and lead the fight for the education and freedom of young African girls and women bringing incredible awareness to the reality of inequality. These tributes, despite being well deserved, are only a fraction of the countless unnamed. </p>
          <blockquote>"The struggle of today is not altogether for today - it is for a vast future also."<cite>-Graca Machel</cite></blockquote>
          
          <p>Even though Africa is a continuous fight against turmoil, greed and corruption, it has created some of the most powerful connections between humankind within itself and within mother nature and is also home to the some of the world's most exotic wildlife and diverse landscapes. Irrigation projects, educational facilities for young girls and boys, animal sanctuaries, sustainable practices and habitat rehabilitation, to name a few, are some of the reasons that make Africa an incredibly special place.</p>
