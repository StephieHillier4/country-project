            <h2>African Tribes</h2>
            <p>Africa is the most naturally diverse continent with over 3,000 tribes, 2,000 languages, 54 countries and 1.5 billion people.<br>Survival International, founded in 1969, was started to fight alongside Indigenous and Tribal peoples to defend their lives and lands. Within each tribe there is usually a distinct language spoken amongst the members, they are true hunters and gatherers and everything is shared. Often there are more than one tribe within a region and a mutual respect of the individual tribal cultures are understood.
            </p>

            <h2>Languages</h2>
            <p>Africa has one of the greatest concentrations of linguistic diversity in the world with Nigeria alone having over 500 languages.<br>Two of the major natively speaking language families that dominate the continent are the Afroasiatic, with over 375 languages throughout the middle-eastern areas, and Niger-Congo, the largest of the two language families covering most of Western Africa.</p>

            <h2>Music, Dance and Food</h2>
            <p>Africa has is an incredibly social economy. Instrumental music techniques, native dances and incredibly savory dishes keeps the African people in high spirits and keeps them connected to their history and ancestors. African music ranges from jazz and blues to rumba and calypso with many in-between. Instruments include the African drum, my personal favorite, piano, xylophone and djembes to name a few.<br>Traditional Africa dishes are some of the most savory, heartwarming dishes you can ever taste. Piri Piri Chicken is one of Mozambique's most popular and enjoyed local dishes and for good reason.Other popular dishes include Cape Breyani, a fragrant dish comprising layers of marinated meat, rice, lentils and spices topped with crisp-fried onions and hard-boiled eggs, Muamba de Galinha, a popular Angolian dish of rich, chicken stew that will be sure to make you want seconds, and B'stilla, a favorite Moroccan dish that is served mainly on special occasions because of its incredibly labour intensive process. A dish well worth the wait.</p>
